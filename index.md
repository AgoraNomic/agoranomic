# Agora Nomic

<div class="row" markdown="1">

<div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">

## Welcome to Agora

Agora is a nomic - a game of rule change, debate, ever-changing gameplay
and scams - played by email. The rules of the game are part of the game,
and ALL of them are subject to potential change. This makes it difficult
to describe Agora, but it also means that gameplay changes frequently
based on what players are interested in at the time.

Some elements tend to stay the same. Changes to rules are proposed by
any player and voted on by all players. Some players, known as Officers,
keep track of the rules and other elements of the game. Commonly, there
are currencies or assets to buy, sell, and trade.

Players can win by a variety of ways, but winning is simply recorded on
the Scroll of Agora and gameplay continues. Winning is usually tied to a
"sub-game", an activity played within Agora. In the past this has
included variants of Diplomacy, Go, and Mao - as well as many games of
our own design.

Crafty and mischievous players may enjoy the time-honored tradition of
scamming. Since rules change frequently, loopholes often appear. Clever
scammers use these loopholes to secure wins for themselves. There is,
however, an art to this: it's considered impolite to do so in a way that
prevents others from having fun. The most elegant scams secure a win and
then quickly clean up the mess.

## Why Agora?

While there are other nomics, Agora has a special place in the history
of nomic. At **27 years old**, it's the longest running nomic. It has
also seen around **200 players** come and go, with an average of 15-20
at any given time. Some players have been playing for more than a
decade. This long life means Agora has seen over **8000 proposals** and
**2600 rules** enacted, amended, and/or repealed.

Agora is purely egalitarian. The rules tend to shy away from too much
power for more experienced players (known as Gerontocracy). We reward
players of long service and great achivement through official
recognition, not special privileges. All players are able to participate
from the moment they join, and all voices are respected in all
discussions. Players come from many countries and backgrounds, and
diversity of opinion and experience is respected and welcomed. As a
symbol of its idealism (and a quirk of the time and place it originates
from) Agora uses the Spivak pronoun system (e/em/eir/eirs) for all
persons.

When disagreement arises about the meaning of rules or result of an
action, they are resolved through a system of judicial cases. Any player
can initiate or volunteer to judge a case, and decisions are upheld or
challenged based on how convincing the judge's arguments are. Such
rulings supplement the rules to resolve issues fairly and keep all
players on the same page. Notable judgments create a sort of common law
for Agora, though they often become outdated by rule changes.

Agora also takes itself relatively seriously compared to other nomics.
Many players see it as a place to experiment with philosophy, political
science, and group dynamics. Agora's relatively unique place as a nomic
that both has existed continuously for decades and freely allows changes
to even the most fundamental rules means it can be somewhat reserved
about changes; yet large-scale changes can and do happen, often after
considerable discussion and debate.

On the other hand, Agorans tend not to be above silliness and having
fun; some players will do things just to see what will happen, or to
create unusual situations merely to observe the resulting chaos.
Agora occasionally experiments with mechanics designed only to shake
things up a bit (such as randomized rule changes, or offices whose
only job is to try to repeal rules); and once went to war over an
insult that Agorans were "a generally boring lot".

## Thinking of playing?
As of **December 2020**, there are **17 active players**. We're always
looking for more!

Play happens across five mailing lists. Please subscribe to all of them:

* [agora-business](http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/agora-business)
  ([public
  archives](http://www.mail-archive.com/agora-business@agoranomic.org/info.html))
  is the main forum used for the vast majority of game actions, such
  as voting on proposals and new players registering;

* [agora-official](http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/agora-official)
  ([public
  archives](http://www.mail-archive.com/agora-official@agoranomic.org/info.html))
  is used for official reports mandated by the rules, like proposal
  distributions and reports of the rules and list of players, and is a
  good place to check on the current state of the game;

* [agora-discussion](http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/agora-discussion)
  ([public
  archives](http://www.mail-archive.com/agora-discussion@agoranomic.org/info.html))
  is the officially supported mailing list for discussion about the
  game and things that go on there, although it cannot be used for
  game actions (posting them to agora-discussion by mistake is quite
  common!).
  
* [gio](https://agoranomic.groups.io/g/main) is the current primary
  backup list. It is a public list that players may use to do actions
  (especially if they're trying to be sneaky). It is mainly used if the
  main lists are down for maintenance.
  
* [tue](http://listserver.tue.nl/mailman/listinfo/agora) normally
  receives no messages. It is an older backup list, now considered
  secondary to gio. Still, it is public and actions *could* be taken
  there on ocassion.
 
For more informal discussion, there is also an official IRC channel,
[##nomic on freenode.net](irc:irc.freenode.net/##nomic) ([web
access](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23nomic)), where
several players of Agora (and other nomics) tend to gather.
      
Although many players prefer to watch for a while rather than playing
(with Agora having attracted quite a sizeable list of "Watchers", who
sometimes join in discussion about the game despite not playing), it's
entirely possible to jump right in and start playing.  Before joining,
you should probably read the rules; the most recent rulesets can
normally be found in the agora-official archives, or
[online](/ruleset/flr.txt).  Probably, you can join by simply sending
a message to agora-business stating that you register, although as
always in nomic, the rules are subject to change.
