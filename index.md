# Agora Nomic

<div class="row" markdown="1">

<div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">

## Welcome to Agora
Agora is a [nomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic), a game in
which the rules can be changed as part of the gameplay itself.  The
concept of Nomic, and an initial ruleset, was invented by [Peter
Suber](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/hometoc.htm) and published in
[an appendix](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/nomic.htm) to his
book *The Paradox of Self-Amendment* in 1982. Agora started with a
very similar ruleset (adapted for play via email) on 30 June 1993, and
since then has become one of the world's longest-lasting nomics.

Over its history of over **27 years**, Agora has had about **200 players**
(though there are usually only about 20 at a time), seen over **8000
proposals**, and over **2600 rules enacted**; but rules are amended
frequently and repealed at much the same rate they are enacted, meaning
that [the ruleset](/ruleset) is often fresh and interesting for new and
experienced players alike, rather than continuously accreting rules
until the game becomes unplayable. Although the game has been won on
over 60 occasions, it can continue on after a win, giving everyone a
chance to succeed (not that winning is easy; most months, nobody
accomplishes it).  The course of the game is charted by its over
**3800 [judicial cases](https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/)**, via which disputes are resolved.

## Why Agora?
Agora is a relatively serious nomic; many of its players see it as an
experiment in philosophy, political science, and group dynamics,
rather than just a game; sometimes it acts more like a country.  It
tends to be relatively conservative as nomics go, in that major rules
changes often take a while to happen and are commonly debated in
advance.  Unlike some other nomics, much of Agora's gameplay is
concerned with the proposals system and the rules themselves, with
many wins having been via exploiting loopholes in even long-standing
rules, just as other players prefer to win in the "intended" fashion.
However, it is not uncommon for substantial subgames to be proposed,
played for a while, and then repealed when players bore with them.

On the other hand, Agorans tend not to be above silliness and having
fun; some players will do things just to see what will happen, or to
create unusual situations merely to observe the resulting chaos.
Agora occasionally experiments with mechanics designed only to shake
things up a bit (such as randomized rule changes, or offices whose
only job is to try to repeal rules); and once went to war over an
insult that Agorans were "a generally boring lot".

## Thinking of playing?
As of **December 2020**, there are **17 active players**. We're always
looking for more!

Play happens across five mailing lists. Please subscribe to all of them:

* [agora-business](http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/agora-business)
  ([public
  archives](http://www.mail-archive.com/agora-business@agoranomic.org/info.html))
  is the main forum used for the vast majority of game actions, such
  as voting on proposals and new players registering;

* [agora-official](http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/agora-official)
  ([public
  archives](http://www.mail-archive.com/agora-official@agoranomic.org/info.html))
  is used for official reports mandated by the rules, like proposal
  distributions and reports of the rules and list of players, and is a
  good place to check on the current state of the game;

* [agora-discussion](http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/agora-discussion)
  ([public
  archives](http://www.mail-archive.com/agora-discussion@agoranomic.org/info.html))
  is the officially supported mailing list for discussion about the
  game and things that go on there, although it cannot be used for
  game actions (posting them to agora-discussion by mistake is quite
  common!).
  
* [gio](https://agoranomic.groups.io/g/main) is the current primary
  backup list. It is a public list that players may use to do actions
  (especially if they're trying to be sneaky). It is mainly used if the
  main lists are down for maintenance.
  
* [tue](http://listserver.tue.nl/mailman/listinfo/agora) normally
  receives no messages. It is an older backup list, now considered
  secondary to gio. Still, it is public and actions *could* be taken
  there on ocassion.
 
For more informal discussion, there is also an official IRC channel,
[##nomic on freenode.net](irc:irc.freenode.net/##nomic) ([web
access](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23nomic)), where
several players of Agora (and other nomics) tend to gather.
      
Although many players prefer to watch for a while rather than playing
(with Agora having attracted quite a sizeable list of "Watchers", who
sometimes join in discussion about the game despite not playing), it's
entirely possible to jump right in and start playing.  Before joining,
you should probably read the rules; the most recent rulesets can
normally be found in the agora-official archives, or
[online](/ruleset/flr.txt).  Probably, you can join by simply sending
a message to agora-business stating that you register, although as
always in nomic, the rules are subject to change.
