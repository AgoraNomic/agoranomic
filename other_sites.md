## Historical Agora Content

Much of this is very old and not maintained by current players. As such, it might not exist still.

* [Zefram's archives](http://www.fysh.org/~zefram/agora/) contain old
  rules, proposals, and mailing list archives.

* The [Agoran Weekly Journal](http://zenith.homelinux.net/awj.php)
  summarises events from 1997 to 2007, and may be updated in the
  future.

* Murphy's site also contains a [list of
  acronyms](http://zenith.homelinux.net/agora_acronyms.php) used in
  agora and a [list of
  wins](http://zenith.homelinux.net/agora_winners.php).

* Andre has a [list of old
  CFJs](http://web.archive.org/web/20130115221259/http://www.win.tue.nl/~engels/stare.txt).

* [omd's CFJ database](http://cfj.qoid.us) displays more recent CFJs
  and their results.

* The [Agora Notary Wiki](http://agora-notary.wikidot.com/) hosted
  details about contracts from late 2008 to early 2010 (and became
  obsolete when contracts were repealed).

* Finally, just for fun, oerjan took [Agora's horoscope](http://home.nvg.org/~oerjan/agora-horoscope/).
